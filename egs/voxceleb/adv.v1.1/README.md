Recipe to evaluate Adversarial Attacks to x-Vector Speaker Verification Systems

## Setup

To run attacks with Adversarial Robustness toolbox, you need to install it in the environment by
```
pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox[pytorch]
```

## Threat Model

Speaker verification pipeline where:
  - Enrollment side is not under attack, x-vectors for enrollment utterances are
    pre-computed and storded on disk
  - Test side is under Adversarial Attacks. 
    The attack adds an inperceptible perturbation to the 
    test waveform to make the system to:
        - Classify target trials as non-targets
        - Classify non-target trials as targets

As attacks happen in waveform domain, test x-vectors cannot be precomputed and
need to be recomputed for each trial.
Also, the speaker verification pipeline needs to be fully differentiable from wave to score,
so the attack algorithm can optimize the perturbation noise.

Two broad types of attacks:
    - White-box: the attacker has access to the x-vector model under attack
    - Transfer based Black-box: the attacker doesn't have access to the x-vector model under attack (black-box model),
       but has access to another x-vector model (white-box). Perturvation is obtained from the white-box model
       and used to attack the black-box model.

Multiple attacks algorithms: FGSM, Iter-FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner.

## Training Data

   - x-Vector network is trained on Voxceleb2 dev + test with augmentations
     - MUSAN noise
     - RIR reverberation

## Test Data

   - Test data is VoxCeleb 1 Original Clean trial list.
   - We don't use the larger Entire and Hard list because of the high computing cost
     of these experiments. 

## Usage

   - Run the run_0*.sh scripts in sequence
   - By default it will use ResNet34 as victim model and Residual E-TDNN as transfer model
   - You can change that modifying the configuration script.
   - For example, to use LResNet34 as transfer model use `config_victim_resnet34_transfer_lresnet.v1.sh` 
     when calling each of the steps as
```bash
run_0*.sh --config-file global_conf/config_victim_resnet34_transfer_lresnet.v1.sh
```

## Recipe Steps:

   - `run_001_prepare_data.sh`
      - Data preparation script to generate Kaldi style data directories for 
          - VoxCeleb2 train+test
          - VoxCeleb1 Original eval sets

   - `run_002_compute_evad.sh`
      - Computes Energy VAD for all datasets

   - `run_003_prepare_noises_rirs.sh`
      - Prepares MUSAN noises, music to be used by SpeechAugment class.
      - Creates Babble noise from MUSAN speech to be used by SpeechAugment class.
      - Prepares RIRs by compacting then into HDF5 files, to be used by SpeechAugment class.

   - `run_004_prepare_victim_xvec_train_data.sh`
      - Prepares audios train the victim x-vector model
      - Transforms all the audios that we are going to use to train the x-vector into a common format, e.g., .flac.
      - Removes silence from the audios
      - Removes utterances shorter than 4secs and speakers with less than 8 utterances.
      - Creates training and validation lists for x-vector training

   - `run_005_train_victim_xvector.sh`
      - Trains the victim x-vector network

   - `run_006_prepare_transfer_xvec_train_data.sh`
      - Prepares audios train the transfer white-box x-vector model
      - If training data for victim and tranfer models is the same, it does nothing
